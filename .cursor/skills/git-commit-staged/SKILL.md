  Helps the agent create Conventional Commits from already staged changes. Use when

# Git Commit (Staged Changes)

## Purpose

Use this skill when **there are changes already staged in git** (after `git add`) and you
need to:

- Inspect what is staged
- Split staged changes into logical commits when needed
- Generate **Conventional Commits** messages
- Execute `git commit`

This skill assumes **changes are already staged**. For unstaged changes, use the `git-commit-unstaged` skill instead.

## Commit message rules

Commit messages created with this skill must follow the project-wide standards
defined in `commit-message-standards.mdc` (Conventional Commits in English).

- Use the `type`, `scope`, summary, and body style described in that rule file.
- Do not redefine or override those standards here; keep this skill focused on
  the workflow for staged changes.

## Workflow (staged changes)

1. **Get staged files and diff**

   - Run `git status --short` to see current state
   - Run `git diff --cached` to get the staged diff

2. **Split changes into logical groups**

   Read the staged diff and decide "one commit per unit" based on:

   - Feature scope (e.g. license setup, API addition, bug fix)
   - Impact area (per file, directory, or module)
   - Change type (separate `feat` from `fix`, `docs` from others, etc.)

   If multiple logical changes are mixed in one staging set:

   - Use `git reset -p` or `git restore --staged -p` to unstage interactively
   - Re-stage each logical group with `git add -p`

3. **Create commit message for each group**

   For each logical group, decide:

   - `type` (required)
   - `scope` (optional; e.g. `core`, `docs`, `ci`, `pkg`, `native`)
   - `summary` (one-line)
   - `body` (optional)

   **Message guidelines**

   - Prefer explaining **why** the change was made, not just what
   - Keep summary concise; use body for details

4. **Final check before commit**

   For each commit:

   - Re-check the diff with `git diff --cached`
   - Confirm the generated commit message matches the diff

5. **Execute commit**

   For each logical group:

   - Ensure only the intended diff is staged
   - Commit with the generated Conventional Commits message:

     ```bash
     git commit -m "type(scope): summary"
     ```

   - If there is a body, use multiple `-m` flags or a here-doc:

     ```bash
     git commit -m "type(scope): summary" -m "Detailed description..."
     ```

   Or:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   type(scope): summary

   Detailed description...
   EOF
   )"
   ```

6. **Verify state after commit**

   - Run `git status` to see if the working tree is clean
   - If more changes remain, repeat steps 1–5 as needed

## Usage notes

- Handle only already-staged changes
- If multiple logical changes are mixed, reorganize staging before splitting commits
- Use existing project history (`git log --oneline`) to align type/scope terminology

## Example

### Example: License file and README license section update

- Changes:
  - Add `LICENSE` (BSD 3-Clause)
  - Update `README.md` license section
- type: `chore`
- scope: `license`
- summary: `add BSD 3-Clause license`

Commit message:

```text
chore(license): add BSD 3-Clause license

Initial license for the speech_kit repository.
```
